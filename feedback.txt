Aron: telegram bot for farms and volunteers
The project is well structured although there are some parts commented not relevant to the functionality.
OOP was implemented, also database. The main module is telebot but also other modules were properly used.
The Database is well structured and the relationship between the tables was precise.
All the cocepts were implemented by the student. 
I just wish this project had also JSON and API implemented.

Python OOP:9/10
Modules: 8/10
Database:9/10
JSON/API:0/10
Overall: 7
